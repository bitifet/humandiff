v1.0.1 - Fixed last token ignoring bug.

    When file2 is larger than file1 last token were ignored because it starts
    AFTER file1 end. (FIXED)

v1.0.0 - Consistent exit status behaviour.

    0: Ok
       Compare files are identical OR conflicts were automatically resolved.

    1: Conflict
       Files differ AND conflicts couldn't automatically resolved.
       (Output file needs human review)

    2: RESERVED, not yet used (Binary Tryed to compare binary file)
       See: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/filearchiv.html#DIFFERR2

    5: Error
       Some error happened.
       (Details logged to stderr)

v0.0.7 - Fixed backward compatibility issue.

    Removed use of array deconstruction because node.JS versions available on
    most current GNU/Linux distributions don't support it yet.

    Added this CHANGELOG.txt file.

v0.0.6 - Fixed wrong 'index' instead of 'humandiff' in readme's USAGE section.
    
    This was caused because this section is generated from actual binary
    help output, but binary uses its calling name as program name which in
    the project is 'index'(.js) and symlink generated in 'npm install -g'
    installation is 'humandiff'.
    
    I renamed entry poing file (index.js) to 'humandiff.js' to avoid this to
    happen again in the future.
    
    Also take the opportunity to update / improve advanced features
    explanation.


v0.0.5 - Smarter property name matching and case insensitive comparsion.
    
   * Smarter property matching: It now detects addition, removal and, in
     some cases, when its not placed at the same position.
   
   * Optional case insensitive comparsion. It also affects to
     propertyNames comparsion.


v0.0.4 - Implemented simple configVar version pre-selection.

    Fixed extra empty row added at the end.
    
    Fixed extra empty row added at the end because of trailing newline in
    the last row of master file (left/old one).
    
    Also added warning message when files differ in having that trailing
    newline at the end row (to avoid seeming diff error because of both
    versions to looking the same).


v0.0.3 - Minor changes.
    
    TODO: Fix extra empty row added at the end.


v0.0.2 - Fixed copy&paste typo (wrong binary name in package.json).

    (This is first that works when installed with 'npm install -g humandiff')


v0.0.1 - Initial implementation.
